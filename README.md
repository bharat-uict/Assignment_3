# Assignment_3

Bharat Contribution:
I worked on two visualizations for this project:

Visualization #1 – Created a faceted boxplot to show the distribution of text messages by Group and Time.
Visualization #2 – Created a faceted bar chart to display the count of text messages across Group and Time.
Both visualizations help illustrate trends in text message activity among different groups at different time points.

Branching
To keep things organized, I created a separate branch for my work. I committed my changes regularly with meaningful messages and pushed my branch to GitHub. Once my work was done, I created a pull request to merge my changes into the main branch after review.

# Assignment_3

Bharat Contribution: I worked on two visualizations for this project:

Visualization #1 – Created a faceted boxplot to show the distribution of text messages by Group and Time. Visualization #2 – Created a faceted bar chart to display the count of text messages across Group and Time. Both visualizations help illustrate trends in text message activity among different groups at different time points.

Branching To keep things organized, I created a separate branch for my work.

Edward's Contribution: I cloned the respository created by Bharat. I took on problem #3 - providing summary statistics of text messages by Time and Group. I first created a new branch for my portion of the work under SummaryStatistics.I approached this by  changing the wide data to long form and obtaining summary statistics stratified by Group and Time. 

Finally, pull requests were created, and each team member reviewed the other's code. After reaching a mutual agreement, the changes were merged into the main branch. The code was then pulled individually from the main branch for a final review before submission.

# Assignment_3

Bharat Contribution: I worked on two visualizations for this project:

Visualization #1 – Created a faceted boxplot to show the distribution of text messages by Group and Time. Visualization #2 – Created a faceted bar chart to display the count of text messages across Group and Time. Both visualizations help illustrate trends in text message activity among different groups at different time points.

Branching To keep things organized, I created a separate branch for my work.

Edward's Contribution: I cloned the respository created by Bharat.
I took on problem #3 - providing summary statistics of text messages by
Time and Group. I first created a new branch for my portion of the work under
SummaryStatistics.
I approached this by  changing the wide data to long form
and obtaining summary statistics stratified by Group and Time.
